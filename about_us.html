        <p>To redefine online dating by creating a space that values real conversations, shared interests, and mutual respect. We're not just another swipe-based app – we're about building meaningful human connections.</p>

        <h2>💡 Why We Created Mate</h2>
        <p>In a world filled with fast-paced swiping and surface-level matches, we wanted to build something different. Mate was born out of a university project by passionate students who saw the need for a dating platform that prioritizes quality over quantity and real stories over just photos.</p>

        <p>We focus on <strong>authenticity, comfort, and user control</strong>, ensuring every user has a safe and empowering experience.</p>

        <h2>🔧 Built With Passion</h2>
        <p>Mate is proudly developed by a dedicated team of students from the University of Ulsan. From design to deployment, every aspect of Mate was crafted with learning, creativity, and care.</p>

        <h2>🔒 Your Safety Matters</h2>
        <p>We take user privacy seriously. Mate incorporates simple yet effective measures to keep your information safe, your interactions respectful, and your matches meaningful.</p>

        <h2>📲 Join the Mate Community</h2>
        <p>Whether you're new to dating apps or tired of the same old experience, Mate is here to offer something better. Discover connections that go beyond the screen.</p>
